# `main`

The current tip-of-tree, absolute latest cutting edge build. Usually functional, though sometimes we accidentally break things.

# `dev`

The latest not fully-tested build.

# `stable`

When we believe we have a particularly useful build, we promote it to the stable channel.
We intend to do this more or less every quarter, but this may vary. We may ship hotfixes
to the stable channel for high-priority bugs, although we intend to do this rarely.
