## About

<h3><div align="center">

**ZI is a fast and feature-rich plugin manager for [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) - [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell).**

</div></h3>

- Has a [turbo mode](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Introduction#turbo-mode-zsh--53) which yields 50-80% [faster](https://github.com/z-shell/pm-perf-test) Zsh startup.

- Allow to install [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/), [Node modules](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Rust](https://crates.io/) packages and almost everything from [GitHub](https://github.com).

- Supports loading [Oh My Zsh and Prezto](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Introduction#oh-my-zsh-prezto) plugins and libraries, however, the implementation isn't framework-specific and doesn't bloat the plugin manager with such code. See our wiki on how to [migrate](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Usage#migration) from other plugin managers.

- The dedicated [packages](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Packages/) that offload the user from providing long and complex commands. See the [Z-Shell ZI](https://github.com/z-shell) organization for a complete list of packages.

- The specialized extensions ‚Äî called [annexes](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Annexes/) ‚Äî allow to extend the plugin manager with new commands, URL-preprocessors (used by e.g.: [z-a-readurl](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-readurl) annex), post-install and post-update hooks and much more.

- The system does not use `$FPATH`, loading multiple plugins don't clutter `$FPATH` with the same number of entries (e.g. `10`, `15` or more). Code is immune to `KSH_ARRAYS` and other options typically causing compatibility problems.

- Provides [reports and statistics](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Commands#reports-and-statistics) about the plugins, such as describing what **aliases**, **functions**, **bindkeys**, **Zle widgets**, **zstyles**, [completions](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Introduction#completion-management), variables, `PATH` and `FPATH` elements a plugin has set up. Allows to quickly [familiarize](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Profiling-plugins) oneself with a new plugin and provides rich and easy-to-digest information that might be helpful on various occasions. supports the unloading of plugins and the ability to list, (un)install, and **selectively disable**, **enable** plugin's completions.

- Test configurations with docker at [playground](https://github.com/z-shell/playground)

- Capabilities: [0fuUpiPs](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Zsh-Plugin-Standard#9-global-capabilities)

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### ZI Loader setup

Forthcoming releases will introduce ZI profiles that allow changing the Zsh environment or configuration files with a single command. The specified way of installation is a part of the upcoming profiles loader.

Create a configuration files directory:

```zsh
zi_config="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/zi"
command mkdir -p $zi_config
```

Download:

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://git.io/zi-loader -o ${zi_config}/init.zsh
```

Add at the top of your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
if [[ -r "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/zi/init.zsh" ]]; then
  source "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/zi/init.zsh" && zzinit
fi
```

- This will:

  - Clone and install ZI if missing.
  - If install successful or not required will load ZI.
  - Enable ZI completions.

- All can be accomplished individually or skipped. The functionality will be attached in documentation subsequently.

#### Quick install

```zsh
# Will make offers or display notes depending on changes or status.
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-zi)" --

# Non interactive. Just clone or update repository.
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-zi)" -- -i skip

# Minimal .zshrc setup. No extras offered.
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-zi)" -- -a skip
```

#### Manual install

Clone repository:

```zsh
zi_home="${HOME}/.zi" && command mkdir -p $zi_home
command git clone https://github.com/z-shell/zi.git "${zi_home}/bin"
```

Source `zi.zsh` from your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
zi_home="${HOME}/.zi"
source "${zi_home}/bin/zi.zsh"
# Next two lines must be below the above two
autoload -Uz _zi
(( ${+_comps} )) && _comps[zi]=_zi
```

#### Post-install 

- Run: `exec zsh` and `zi self-update`.
