### Clean Pull Request guidelines

  Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

-   Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
-   Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
    -   `git clone https://github.com/{YOUR-USERNAME}/zi`
-   Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
    -   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/z-shell/zi.git`
-   If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
-   Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `main`.
-   Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
-   Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
-   If there is related tests please run them.
-   Write or adapt tests as needed.
-   Add or change the documentation as needed.
-   Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
-   Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
-   From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `main`!
-   Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
    your extra branch(es).

> Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code. ([examples](https://www.google.com/search?q=english+"present+tense+example"))

## Commit messages 

- Use the Present Tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the Imperative Mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests, where possible.

## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new feature?Take a look at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/discussions) to see if it's already being discussed. You can help us by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/issues). Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

-   _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
-   _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
-   _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
-   _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**

### How to submit a Pull Request

1. Search our repository for open or closed
   [Pull Requests](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/pulls)
   that relate to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Fork the project
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing_feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing_feature'`) Z-Shell ZI uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), so please follow the specification in your commit messages.
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feat/amazing_feature`)
6. [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/compare?expand=1)

## Submitting Contribution

Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

### Step 0 : Find an issue

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

### Step 1 : Fork the Project

- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile.
Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>  
cd <repo-name>  
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>  
```  

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.

```bash
git remote update
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
```  

### Step 2 : Branch

Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

```bash
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
git checkout -b branch_name
```

### Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned

- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:

```bash  
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
git add <some files>
```

### Step 4 : Commit

- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:

```bash
# This message get associated with all files you have changed  
git commit -m "message"  
```

- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

### Step 5 : Work Remotely

- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```bash  
# To push your work to your remote repository
git push -u origin Branch_Name
```

### Step 6 : Pull Request

- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.  

### Note : Do not add images, rather ðŸ‘‡ 

- We plan to remove all the images and screenshots from our repository and link them to markdown files.
    
    #### How to do that? 

    - You can do that by hosting all you images and screenshots to any images hosting sites such as [imgur](https://imgur.com/), [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/), [postimages](https://postimages.org/).
    - Then link your uploaded images to README files.
